# ==========================================
# Good examples:
# 
# feat(backend): add WebSocket support for real-time detection
# 
# Implements real-time detection streaming using WebSocket
# connections. Clients can now receive detection results
# as they happen without polling the API.
# 
# Fixes #42
#
# ==========================================
# 
# fix(frontend): resolve bounding box coordinate scaling
# 
# Detection boxes were not properly scaled to match video
# dimensions. Fixed coordinate transformation to ensure
# accurate box positioning on all screen sizes.
# 
# BREAKING CHANGE: Detection response format changed
# from xywh to xyxy coordinates
#
# ==========================================
